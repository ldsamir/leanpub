# LeanPub
## Steps:
1. `src/leanpub.py`: Within this script I used [`BeautifulSoup`](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for scraping over the pages and finding only `FREE` books. After finding them I am storing them into `BLink.json`;
2. `src/leanpub_selenium.py`: Within this script I used [`Selenium WebDriver`](https://selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/) to automate adding each book to the shopping cart. You can make logging in possible by uncommenting some lines, but it is possible without logging in as well. One of the hardest parts I solved was to change the scrollbar's value and one of the hardest parts I could not solve was to click `Continue` button to go to the next step for purchase. I think, since they used `ReactJS`, it was not easy for me to handle it. But I thought I need just all items in the shopping cart, I can handle `checkout` part manually; so, I did. I got mail and saved the `HTML` of the mail page into `leanpub_gmail.html`, because now I have the links to `PDF`, `EPUB`, and `MOBI` version of the books;
3. `src/leanpub_download.py`: Although I used `download` in the name of the file, I don't download anything by using it. Within this script I used [`BeautifulSoup`](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for scraping over `leanpub_gmail.html` and store all relevant information (the authors, the language of the book, the links to specific download options, etc.) into the `BData.json`;
4. `src/leanpub_categorization.py`: Within this script I used [`BeautifulSoup`](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for scraping over the pages of the various categories and updating `BData.json` by adding the fields of the categories. Don't forget: one book might belong to several categories;
5. `src/leanpub_foldering.py`: Within this script I used [`BeautifulSoup`](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) for downloading `PDF` version of all books using the previously obtained information in `BData.json`. I used categorization for the folder part; in other words, after downloading you can see one book can appear in multiple folders.

## Notes:
- This is not `hack`: I used some web scraping and web automation techniques within `Python` to legally download free books from [LeanPub](http://www.leanpub.com). Since what I downloaded can be legally downloaded, I am not doing any illegal thing.
- I am not going to attach `BLink.json`, `BData.json`, and `leanpub_gmail.html`; they are available upon request!
